---

Built for laptops that double as workstations and gaming rigs. Default-deny networking, per-app Bubblewrap prisons, encrypted DNS with community-maintained blocklists, and custom Rust daemons for the gaps Wayland still leaves open. Everything driven from a single `user-config.nix`.

## Why Perseus

- **Default-deny network.** Every outbound connection is queued to OpenSnitch for per-app approval. DNS goes through local `dnscrypt-proxy` over DoH with OISD + HaGeZi blocklists merged daily.
- **Bubblewrap prisons, no Flatpak.** Every proprietary desktop app runs in a custom `bwrap` derivation with explicit filesystem, socket, and D-Bus scope. No runtime, fully declarative.
- **Custom Rust daemons** fill gaps the Wayland ecosystem still hasn't closed (see [System Architecture](#system-architecture)).
- **Niri + DankMaterialShell.** Scrollable-tiling Wayland with a real shell UI — widgets, launcher, notifications, media controls.
- **Gaming works.** NVIDIA Prime offloading, `gamescope`, `gamemode`, `mangohud`, Steam sandboxed with Proton and controller support.
- **One file to rule them all.** `user-config.nix` toggles GPU, VPN, dev languages, browsers. No spelunking through modules.

## Quickstart

> Requires NixOS Yarara (26.05) or later, ~20 GB free, on bare metal.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JonNesvold/perseus
cd perseus
./setup.sh                                # interactive wizard, writes user-config.nix
sudo nixos-install --flake .#<hostname>
sudo reboot
```

> **First boot:** set `hasGPU = false;` and `vpn = false;` in `user-config.nix`. Enable both after the system boots successfully.

## System Architecture

Perseus runs on **Niri** (scrollable-tiling Wayland compositor) with **DankMaterialShell (DMS)** providing the shell UI — widgets, app launcher, media controls, notifications, and system toggles.

To handle gaps in the Wayland ecosystem, Perseus ships custom Rust daemons:

- **`clammy`** — Wayland power and display management daemon. Hooks into D-Bus/logind and the `ext_idle_notify_v1` Wayland protocol to manage: gradual screen dimming before lock, lock screen activation, DPMS toggling, system suspend, lid switch handling, and external monitor awareness for clamshell mode. Also feeds dock state into PAM — fingerprint auth is skipped when the lid is closed on a dock (the reader is under the lid).

- **`ntl-daemon` (NastyTechLords)** — Security auditing daemon. Runs every 6 hours via systemd timer, inspecting processes, network state, filesystem integrity, privacy leaks, and Nix configuration. Reports logged to `/var/log/nastyTechLords/`. Run `ntl report` for the latest audit.

- **`perseus-net`** — Rust-based Wi-Fi menu.

## Application Sandboxing

Every proprietary desktop app runs in a custom **Bubblewrap prison** — no Flatpak, no runtime, fully declarative Nix derivations:

- **Slack, Teams, Spotify, Edge, Logseq, Steam** — private mount/pid/ipc namespaces, isolated fake `$HOME` per app, Wayland-native rendering, GPU passthrough for calls and playback, memory caps via systemd scopes.
- **Filtered D-Bus.** Each prison talks to a per-app `xdg-dbus-proxy` socket whitelisting portals (camera, screenshare, notifications, MPRIS) and nothing else. A compromised app can't read your clipboard, script your session, or enumerate services on the bus.
- **URL escape hatch done right.** An `xdg-open` shim inside each jail forwards links through the OpenURI portal to your real browser. Browser sign-in flows (Slack SSO) round-trip back into the prison via scheme handlers and a persistent per-app `/tmp` so Electron's single-instance socket survives.
- **Teams' icon is the poop emoji.** Edge's is the vomit emoji. Iconography as threat modeling.
- **`jail-dev`** — throwaway containers for untrusted NPM/Node projects: no SSH agent, isolated filesystem, `.env` injection, jail indicator in the prompt.

## Privacy & Network Defense

The network stack is default-deny.

- **OpenSnitch + nftables**: All outbound traffic is queued to OpenSnitch for per-application approval. The nftables output chain explicitly allows only DNS (to local `dnscrypt-proxy`) and WireGuard (by fwmark) before queuing everything else to OpenSnitch **without** the `bypass` flag — if OpenSnitch crashes, DNS and VPN keep working but all other traffic is dropped.
- **Encrypted DNS**: `dnscrypt-proxy2` on `127.0.0.1:53` handles all DNS (Cloudflare/Quad9, DNSSEC required). Blocklist merged daily from **OISD big** + **HaGeZi** native vendor-telemetry lists (Windows/Office, Apple, TikTok, Samsung, LG webOS) + HaGeZi DoH/VPN-bypass list — ~350k domains, community-maintained, auto-updated.
- **Policy blackhole**: Deliberate policy blocks (AI coding assistants: Copilot, Tabnine, Codeium, Cursor, CodeWhisperer, JetBrains AI) plus app-telemetry endpoints not covered by community lists, pinned in `/etc/hosts`. Telemetry opt-out environment variables set system-wide.
- **VPN**: Native WireGuard integration for Mullvad, secrets encrypted via `sops-nix` and `age`. Tailscale coexists — a route reconciler keeps Mullvad from swallowing the tailnet, and Tailscale's DNS is disabled so nothing bypasses dnscrypt.
- **Network hardening**: MAC address randomization (Wi-Fi and Ethernet), disabled IP forwarding, SYN cookies, martian logging, ICMP echo disabled.
- **AppArmor**: Enabled with `killUnconfinedConfinables`.
- **No swap**: Both swap devices and zram are force-disabled to prevent memory dumps.
- **Docked-aware PAM**: Fingerprint auth (lock screen, sudo, polkit) is skipped when docked with the lid closed — instant password fallback instead of a timeout on an unreachable reader.

## Browsers

**Firefox** provisioned with declarative policies.

- **Hardening**: **Betterfox** (`Fastfox.js`, `Peskyfox.js`, `Securefox.js`, `Smoothfox.js`) loaded via flake input into `extraConfig`. On top of that, declarative `settings.nix` locks down telemetry, disables Pocket, blocks fingerprinting, enforces HTTPS-only, disables WebRTC, clears data on shutdown, and blocks DoH/DoT bypass. Firefox Studies and Normandy are disabled.
- **Theming**: **Catppuccin** `userChrome.css` loaded via flake input.
- **Extensions**: Force-installed and pinned: uBlock Origin (with curated filter lists), DarkReader, Firemonkey, ClearURLs, SponsorBlock. All other extension installs are policy-blocked.

## Gaming

- **NVIDIA**: Prime offloading configured (`nvidia-drm.modeset=1`, early KMS).
- **Performance tooling**: `gamemode`, `gamescope`, `mangohud`.
- **Steam**: Bubblewrap-jailed with pressure-vessel/Proton compatibility, isolated Steam home, memory caps.
- **Controllers**: DualSense and generic gamepad support via `antimicrox` and system uinput access.

## Development Environment

- **Language stacks**: Python, Go, Rust, Node.js, and Android toggled via `user-config.nix`. Paths and environment variables merged dynamically.
- **Per-project isolation**: `direnv` with Nix integration — drop a `.envrc` in any project directory for automatic isolated environments.
- **Editor**: Neovim via `nixvim` — Catppuccin theme, Treesitter, Telescope, `conform.nvim`, and language-specific LSPs.
- **Containers**: Rootless Podman for daily use; dockerd available behind sudo (no docker group — it's root-equivalent).
- **Jailed frontend dev**: `jail-dev` launches a Bubblewrap container for untrusted Node/NPM work with restricted filesystem and no SSH agent.

## Configuration

Everything toggleable lives in `user-config.nix`:

| Key           | Type    | Effect                                               |
| ------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `isLaptop`    | bool    | Enables clammy (idle/lock/suspend, docked-aware PAM) |
| `hasGPU`      | bool    | NVIDIA drivers + Prime offloading                    |
| `thunderbolt` | bool    | Thunderbolt/dock support                             |
| `vpn`         | bool    | Mullvad WireGuard + sops-nix secrets                 |
| `email`       | bool    | Thunderbird                                          |
| `browsers`    | list    | `"firefox"`, `"librewolf"`, `"brave"`                |
| `devTools`    | list    | `"python"`, `"go"`, `"rust"`, `"node"`, `"android"`  |
| `extraHosts`  | attrset | Custom `/etc/hosts` entries                          |

## VPN Setup (Optional)

Requires `vpn = true;` in `user-config.nix`.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/sops/age
nix-shell -p age -c "age-keygen -o ~/.config/sops/age/keys.txt"
# Add the resulting public key to .sops.yaml
# Place your WireGuard config in secrets/wireguard.yaml under mullvad_conf
nix-shell -p sops -c "sops -e -i secrets/wireguard.yaml"
```

## Maintenance

```bash
nix flake update                                    # Update inputs
sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#<hostname>      # Rebuild
sudo nixos-rebuild switch --rollback                # Rollback
ntl report                                          # Security audit report
```

## Shipped

- ~~**Bubblewrap-only sandboxing.**~~ Done. Flatpak eliminated — every isolated app is a custom `bwrap` derivation with per-app filtered D-Bus.
- ~~**Community-maintained DNS blocklists.**~~ Done. OISD + HaGeZi merged daily into dnscrypt-proxy; hand-rolled hosts entries reduced to deliberate policy blocks.
- ~~**Least-privilege sudo.**~~ Done. NOPASSWD reduced from `ALL` to three exact commands.

## Roadmap

- **Secure Boot via Lanzaboote.** Signed boot chain end-to-end, `sbctl`-managed keys, kernel and initrd verified before handoff.
- **Encrypted root + impermanence.** LUKS on root, wipe `/` on every boot, persist only what's explicitly declared.
- **Multi-host support.** Promote `hosts/default/` to a proper multi-host layout with shared modules and per-host overrides.
- **Auditable build provenance.** All flake inputs pinned in CI, `nix flake metadata` diffs surfaced on each release.
- **Reproducible install ISO.** A `nix build .#installer` target producing a custom ISO with `setup.sh` baked in.

### Paranoid Mode

Optional hardening for users with stricter threat models:

- **Hardware-backed secrets.** YubiKey or SoloKey for SSH auth, sudo, sops-nix age key, and LUKS unlock. Pull the token — secrets stop decrypting.

## Threat Model & Known Trade-offs

Honesty over marketing:

- **Steam's jail is the weakest** — pressure-vessel needs broad device and sysfs access; Proton runs a nested container inside the prison. It isolates your real `$HOME`, not much more.
- **Prisons read `/etc` read-only.** Root-only secrets (shadow, WireGuard keys) are unreadable to the jailed uid regardless; world-readable config is visible.
- **OpenSnitch fail-closed is deliberate** — a crashed daemon drops all non-DNS/VPN traffic rather than failing open.
- **X11 is not fully gone.** Steam and some Electron GPU processes still ride xwayland-satellite.
